here is another game clone, this one is of 2048

again , heres a link to the game in case youve never heard of it - https://play2048.co/

i really liked this project, especially working with my idea to use a list of lists to make a 2d matrix for the game

this project was done entirely by me (with one exception) , i never resorted to ai or searching online for help (except for line 13 in 2048withdebug.py - a problem ive never come across before)

although this was my most rewarding project, it was also undoubtedly my most confusing one.
when i looked through my files and found it, i saw that it was actually incomplete. there were still alot bugs and issues where it would be inconsistent with the original game rules.

it was actually so confusing to read and understand the code to fix it (i had a habit of avoiding the use of comments), that i ended up just doing the entire thing from scratch again

i uploaded the old program as well (2048old.py)

there are two versions of the final program , 2048withdebug.py and 2048forplayer.py
the first contains debug prints for when i was working on it (hopefully it makes the code easier to understand)
the second is a cleaned up version without debug prints and error handling

hopefully the comments are enough to explain whats going on in the code
