this is a small game that took me about two days, its a simple clone of wordle, a game i love
heres a link to the game in case you've never heard of it - https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html

both text files are the official (i hope) word lists i downloaded from a github repository i cant find the link to anymore (though here is an something similar : https://gist.github.com/scholtes/94f3c0303ba6a7768b47583aff36654d)

wordle1.txt is the list of words the game chooses from                     - 2k words
wordle2.txt is the list of words that the game recognises as valid guesses - 14k words (much more generous)
