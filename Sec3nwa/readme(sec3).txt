this was a Non-Weighted Assesmnent project from our computing teachers. (the pdf is the task they gave us)

orginally it was group work, but as my team (the teacher allowed us to choose our friends as team members) wasnt good at coding, i ended up having to do most of the functions

saying  i did it myself is definitely an overstatement, about 50% of the code was by Chatgpt (this was only a few months after we started learning python)

i did learn alot though, i made sure to ask chatgpt to explain the code it gave me

im not sure if the code is complete so expect some errors
