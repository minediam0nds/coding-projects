this was my very first coding project, which started as a challenge from one of my friends.

i only knew the very basics of python, so i relied on chatgpt for ideas and debugging (a lot despite the small number of lines)

i had a lot of fun creating and playing this game. this was the project that really sparked my passion for coding, and brought me to my next project (texas holdem)
